![Ivy Demo](demo.gif =250x250)
Ivy Bot will greet your new Discord member with a reaction emoji based on the
first letter or first two letters of their user.

If no emoji is found, one is randomly selected.
If an emoji has been used in a recent set amount (Default is 20) then a random one is
chosen.

A command handler has also been added for future features.
